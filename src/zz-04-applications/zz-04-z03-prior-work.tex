This section includes an overview of some of the works and applications existing in the ZKP world. 

\WANTED[Contribution needed: add more references]

ZKP protocols for anonymous credentials have been studied extensively in academic spaces \cite{2010:SCN:Solving-Revocation-with-Efficient-Update-of-Anonymous-Credentials,
2014:architecture-for-ABC-technologies,
2017:ccs:Practical-UC-Secure-Delegatable-Credentials-with-attributes,
2017:SP:Accumulators-with-Applications-to-Anonymity-Preserving-Revocation,
2018:NSDI:zkLedger}.  
Products such as Miracl, Val:ID, Sovrin \cite{2018:sovrin}, and LibZmix \cite{2019:github:libzmix} offer practical solutions to achieve privacy-preserving identity frameworks.  

Zerocash began as an academic work and was later developed into a product ensuring anonymous transactions \cite{2014:BCGGMTV:SP:Zerocash}. 
Baby ZoE enables Zerocash over Ethereum \cite{2018:github:baby-zoe}.
HAWK also uses zk-SNARKS to enable smart-contracts with transactional privacy \cite{2016:SP:Hawk}.
