%%%%%%%%%%%% THIS FILE:
% Latest update: 2022-07-14
% This file explains the folder structure, and how to compile the PDF file
% Modifications: Please do not edit prior to talking with the ZKProof editors
% This LaTeX project is open for collaboration under the ZKProof.org terms


%%%%%% LOCAL COMPILATION:
% The main file for compilation is zkpcomref.tex
% Optimized for compilation with xetex
% The bibliography is using biblatex and biber
% Check that 'biber' is set as the processor working with biblatex
% A Diff PDF file can be compiled using latexpand and latexdiff


%%%%%%%%%%%% VERSIONS

  
%%%%%% VERSION 0
% Version 0 (2018-08-01) corresponds to documents in the proceedings of the
% 1st ZKProof workshop, which included one document per workshop track
% (security, implementation, applications) and the zkproof charter


%%%%%% VERSION 0.1
% Version 0.1 (2019-04-11) was a porting to LaTeX of the ZKProof docs
% downloaded in Mar-2019 from https://zkproof.org/documents.html
% The porting included editorial adjustments for indexation, consistency, etc.
% The underlying content was authored by the ZKProof team/collaborators.

  
%%%%%%% VERSION 0.2
% Version 0.2 (2019-12-31) resulted from a more structured editorial process
% It followed the PEC comments about version 0.1, the topics discussed in the 
% 2nd ZKProof workshop, and the creation of GitHub issues  


%%%%%%% VERSION 0.3
% Version 0.3 (2022-07-18) resulted from various additions, including a 
% revision of the "Paradigms" chapter, with various new sections


%%%%%%% Developing a new VERSION <v1>.<v2>.x
% Version 0.<v2>.x, where "x" is literal, is used to designate any compilation
% of a version in progress after version 0.<v2> and before 0.<v2+1>


%%%%%%% DIFF
% Each new version may include commands \revblock[...][...]{...} or 
% \revblock[...]{...} to mark where a change has been made. These commands are
% should be cleaned out of the LaTeX source at each new phase of contributions.
% Their use can be found using the following regex (with recursion):
% \\revblock((\[(?:[^][]+|(?1))*+\])*)(\{(?:[^}{]+|(?3))*+\})

% The Booleans boolShowFeedback and boolDiff in the compilation file are used 
% to say whether to print out the table of comments, and whether or not to 
% prepare the document for diffing. The later one will control the definition 
% of commands as \revblock and others
