% Initial version: 2019-04-01 (Luís Brandão)
% This file explains the folder structure, and how to compile the PDF file
% Modifications: Please do not edit prior to talking with the ZKProof editors
% This LaTeX project is open for collaboration under the ZKProof.org terms


%%%%%%%%%%%% VERSIONS


%%%%%% LOCAL COMPILATION:
% The main file for compilation is zkproof-community-reference.tex
% The bibliography is using biblatex and biber
% Check that 'biber' is set as the processor working with biblatex
% A Diff PDF file is compiled using latexpand and latexdiff
  

%%%%%% VERSION 0.1
% Version 0.1 (2019-04-11) was a porting to LaTeX of the ZKProof docs
% downloaded in Mar-2019 from https://zkproof.org/documents.html
% The porting included editorial adjustments for indexation, consistency, etc.
% The underlying content was authored by the ZKProof team/collaborators.

  
%%%%%%% VERSION 0.2
% Version 0.2 (2019-12-31) resulted from a more structured editorial process
% It followed the PEC comments about version 0.1, the topics discussed in the 
% 2nd ZKProof workshop, and the creation of GitHub issues  

%%%%%%% Developing a new VERSION <v1>.<v2>.x
% Version 0.2.x, where "x" is literal, is used to designate any compilation
% of a version in progress after version 0.2 and before 0.3


%%%%%%% DIFF
% Each new version may include commands \revblock[...][...]{...} or 
% \revblock[...]{...} to mark where a change has been made. These commands are
% should be cleaned out of the LaTeX source at each new phase of contributions.
% Their use can be found using the following regex (with recursion):
% \\revblock((\[(?:[^][]+|(?1))*+\])*)(\{(?:[^}{]+|(?3))*+\})

% The Booleans boolShowFeedback and boolDiff in the compilation file are used 
% to say whether to print out the table of comments, and whether or not to 
% prepare the document for diffing. The later one will control the definition 
% of commands as \revblock and others
