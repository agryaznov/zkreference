The development of this community reference counts with the support of numerous individuals.


\textbf{Version 0.}
The ``proceedings'' of the 1st ZKProof workshop (Boston, May 2018) formed the initial basis for this document.
The contributions were organized in three tracks:

\end{itemize}


\textbf{Version 0.1.}
	Prior to the 2nd ZKProof workshop, the ZKProof organization team requested feedback from NIST about the developed documentation.
	The NIST PEC team (Luís Brandão, René Peralta, Angela Robinson) then elaborated the 
``NIST comments on the initial ZKProof documentation'' with 28 comments/suggestions 
for subsequent development of a ``Community Reference Document''.
	Luís Brandão ported to LaTeX the proceedings into a LaTeX version, along with inline comments, which became named as version 0.1.


\textbf{Version 0.2.}
	The contributions from version 0.1 to version 0.2 followed the editorial process initiated at the 2nd ZKProof Workshop (Berkeley, April 2019).
	Several suggested contributions stemmed from the breakout discussions in the workshop, which were possible by the collaboration of \emph{scribes}, \emph{moderators} and \emph{participants}, as documented in the Workshop Notes \cite{2019:zkproof:notes-2nd-workshop}.
	The actual content contributions were developed thereafter by several \emph{contributors}, including Yu Hang, Eduardo Morais, Justin Thaler, Ivan Visconti, Riad Wahby and Yupeng Zhang,
besides the NIST PEC team (Luís Brandão, René Peralta, Angela Robinson) 
and the Editors team (Daniel Benarroch, Luís Brandão, Eran Tromer).
	The detailed description of the changes, contributions and contributors appears in the ``diff'' version of the community reference.


\textbf{Miscellaneous.}
	A general ``thank you'' goes to all who have so far collaborated with the ZKProof initiative.
	This includes the workshop speakers, participants, organizers and sponsors, as well as the ZKProof steering committee and program committee members, and the participants in the online ZKProof forum.
	Detailed information about ZKProof is available on the \href{https://zkproof.org/}{zkproof.org} website.
