This appendix congregates summaries of proposals presented and discussed in ZKProof workshops.

The 2\textsuperscript{nd} ZKProof Workshop counted with the presentation of four proposals:

\begin{itemize}
\item J-R1CS --- a JSON Lines file format for R1CS
\item Interoperability of zero-knowledge tools
\item Commit-and-prove functionality
\item Deterministic Generation of Elliptic Curves for ZK Systems
\end{itemize}


%%% Each summary is expected to be up to 2 pages only
