\section{Introduction}  % and Motivation %%% uniformizing the title of the intro section of each chapter
\label{apps:intro}
 
This chapter aims to overview existing techniques for building ZKP-based applications, including designing the protocols to meet best-practice security requirements.
We distinguish between high-level and low-level applications, where the former are the protocols designed for specific use-cases and the latter are the necessary underlying operations or sub-protocols.
Each use case admits a circuit, and we discuss the sub-circuits needed to ensure security and functionality of the protocol.
We refer to the circuits as \emph{predicates} and the sub-circuits as \emph{gadgets}:
\begin{itemize}

\item {\bfseries \hypertarget{def:predicate}{Predicate}:} 
The relation or condition that the statement and witness must satisfy.
Can be represented as a circuit.

\item \textbf{\hypertarget{def:gadget}{Gadget}:} 
The underlying tools needed to construct the predicate.  
In some cases, a gadget can be interpreted as a security requirement 
(e.g., using the commitment verification gadget is equivalent to ensuring the privacy of underlying data).

\end{itemize}


	Recall from \refsec{security:syntax}
the syntax of a proof system between a prover and verifier.
	As we will see, the protocols can be abstracted and generalized to admit several use-cases; 
similarly, there exist compilers that will generate the necessary gadgets from commonly used programming languages. 
	Creating the constraint systems is a fundamental part of the applications of ZKP, which is the reason why there is a large variety of front-end software options available.

\paragraph{Functionality vs.\ performance.}\pslabel{par:apps:intro:functionality-vs-performance}

	The design of ZKPs is subject to the tradeoff between functionality and performance. 
	Users would like to have powerful ZKPs, in the sense that the system permits constructing %to construct 
proofs for any predicate, which %what 
leads to the necessity of universal ZKPs. 
	On the other hand, users would like to have efficient constructions. 
	According to Table~\ref{tab:apps:APIS-and-interfaces-by-univ-and-preproc}, it is possible to classify ZKPs as:
(i) universal or non-universal;
(ii) scalable or non-scalable; and 
(iii) preprocessing or non-preprocessing. 
	Item (i) is related to the functionality of the underlying %subjacent 
ZKP, while items (ii) and (iii) are related to performance. 
	The utilization of zk-SNARKs allows %to have 
universal ZKPs with very efficient verifiers. 
	However, many proposals %%% LB editorial: changed ``most'' (which is very contextual to a moment in time) to ``many''
depend upon an expensive preprocessing, which makes such systems hard to scale for some use-cases. 
	A technique called \textit{Proof-Carrying Data} (PCD), originally proposed in Ref.~\cite{2010:ICS:proof-carrying-data}, 
allows obtaining %to obtain 
\textit{recursive composition} for existing ZKPs in a modular way. %, which
	This means that zk-SNARKs can be used as a building block to construct scalable and non-preprocessing solutions.
	%thus obtaining 
	The result is not only an efficient verifier, as in zk-SNARKs, but also a prover whose consumption of computational resources is efficient, in particular with respect to memory requirements, as described in Refs.~\cite{2017:Alg:Scalable-Zero-Knowledge-Via-Cycles-of-Elliptic-Curves} and~\cite{2013:Recursive-Composition-and-Bootstrapping-for-SNARKS-and-Proof-carrying-Data}.

The subsequent three sections present three ZKP use-cases:
%In this document, we present three ZKP use-cases: 
%identity framework, asset transfer and regulation compliance and emphasize the incorporation of suitable gadgets to ensure security of these protocols.  
\refsec{apps:id-framework} describes a use-case related to \emph{identity management};
\refsec{apps:asset-transfer} examines an application context related to \emph{asset transfer};
\refsec{apps:regulation-compliance} exemplifies one use-case related to \emph{regulation compliance}.
