A polynomial commitment scheme allows a committer to commit to a polynomial with a short string that can be used by a verifier to confirm claimed evaluations of the committed polynomial. Although the homomorphic commitment schemes in the literature can be used to achieve this goal, the sizes of their commitments are linear in the degree of the committed polynomial. On the other hand, polynomial commitments in our schemes are of constant size (single elements). The overhead of opening a commitment is also constant; even opening multiple evaluations requires only a constant amount of communication overhead. Therefore, our schemes are useful tools to reduce the communication cost in cryptographic protocols. On that front, we apply our polynomial commitment schemes to four problems in cryptography: verifiable secret sharing, zero-knowledge sets, credentials and content extraction signatures.},

We also use a (presumably) weaker security assumption, and have tighter security reductions.

We show that there is no reduction from OR-SAT to any set A where the length of the output is bounded by a polynomial in n, unless NP⊆coNP/poly, and the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy collapses. This result settles an open problem proposed by Bodlaender et al. (2008) [6] and Harnik and Naor (2006) [20] and has a number of implications. (i) A number of parametric NP problems, including Satisfiability, Clique, Dominating Set and Integer Programming, are not instance compressible or polynomially kernelizable unless NP⊆coNP/poly. (ii) Satisfiability does not have PCPs of size polynomial in the number of variables unless NP⊆coNP/poly. (iii) An approach of Harnik and Naor to constructing collision-resistant hash functions from one-way functions is unlikely to be viable in its present form. (iv) (Buhrman–Hitchcock) There are no subexponential-size hard sets for NP unless NP is in co-NP/poly. We also study probabilistic variants of compression, and show various results about and connections between these variants. To this end, we introduce a new strong derandomization hypothesis, the Oracle Derandomization Hypothesis, and discuss how it relates to traditional derandomization assumptions.},

abstract = {When delegating computation to a service provider, as in the cloud computing paradigm, we seek some reassurance that the output is correct and complete. Yet recomputing the output as a check is inefficient and expensive, and it may not even be feasible to store all the data locally. We are therefore interested in what can be validated by a streaming (sublinear space) user, who cannot store the full input, or perform the full computation herself. Our aim in this work is to advance a recent line of work on "proof systems" in which the service provider proves the correctness of its output to a user. The goal is to minimize the time and space costs of both parties in generating and checking the proof. Only very recently have there been attempts to implement such proof systems, and thus far these have been quite limited in functionality.Here, our approach is two-fold. First, we describe a carefully chosen instantiation of one of the most efficient general-purpose constructions for arbitrary computations (streaming or otherwise), due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum [19]. This requires several new insights and enhancements to move the methodology from a theoretical result to a practical possibility. Our main contribution is in achieving a prover that runs in time O(S(n) log S(n)), where S(n) is the size of an arithmetic circuit computing the function of interest; this compares favorably to the poly(S(n)) runtime for the prover promised in [19]. Our experimental results demonstrate that a practical general-purpose protocol for verifiable computation may be significantly closer to reality than previously realized.Second, we describe a set of techniques that achieve genuine scalability for protocols fine-tuned for specific important problems in streaming and database processing. Focusing in particular on non-interactive protocols for problems ranging from matrix-vector multiplication to bipartite perfect matching, we build on prior work [8, 5] to achieve a prover that runs in nearly linear-time, while obtaining optimal tradeoffs between communication cost and the user's working memory. Existing techniques required (substantially) superlinear time for the prover. Finally, we develop improved interactive protocols for specific problems based on a linearization technique originally due to Shen [33]. We argue that even if general-purpose methods improve, fine-tuned protocols will remain valuable in real-world settings for key problems, and hence special attention to specific problems is warranted.},

abstract = {We initiate the study of a proof system model that naturally combines interactive proofs (IPs) and probabilistically-checkable proofs (PCPs), and generalizes interactive PCPs (which consist of a PCP followed by an IP). We define an interactive oracle proof (IOP) to be an interactive proof in which the verifier is not required to read the prover's messages in their entirety; rather, the verifier has oracle access to the prover's messages, and may probabilistically query them. IOPs retain the expressiveness of PCPs, capturing NEXP rather than only PSPACE, and also the flexibility of IPs, allowing multiple rounds of communication with the prover. IOPs have already found several applications, including unconditional zero knowledge [BCGV16], constant-rate constant-query probabilistic checking [BCG+16], and doubly-efficient constant-round IPs for polynomial-time bounded-space computations [RRR16].},

abstract = {Systems for verifiable outsourcing incur costs for a prover, a verifier, and precomputation; outsourcing makes sense when the combination of these costs is cheaper than not outsourcing. Yet, when prior works impose quantitative thresholds to analyze whether outsourcing is justified, they generally ignore prover costs. Verifiable ASICs (VA)---in which the prover is a custom chip---is the other way around: its cost calculations ignore precomputation.This paper describes a new VA system, called Giraffe; charges Giraffe for all three costs; and identifies regimes where outsourcing is worthwhile. Giraffe's base is an interactive proof geared to data-parallel computation. Giraffe makes this protocol asymptotically optimal for the prover and improves the verifier's main bottleneck by almost 3x, both of which are of independent interest. Giraffe also develops a design template that produces hardware designs automatically for a wide range of parameters, introduces hardware primitives molded to the protocol's data flows, and incorporates program analyses that expand applicability. Giraffe wins even when outsourcing several tens of sub-computations, scales to 500x larger computations than prior work, and can profitably outsource parts of programs that are not worthwhile to outsource in full.},
