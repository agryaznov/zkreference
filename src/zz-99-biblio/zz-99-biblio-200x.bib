We prove that the complement L has a constant-round interactive proof of complexity that depends only exponentially on b. This provides the first evidence that for NP- complete languages, we cannot expect interactive provers to be much more "laconic" than the standard NP proof. When the proof system is further restricted (e.g., when b = 1, or when we have perfect completeness), we get significantly better upper bounds on the complexity of L.},

abstract = {We continue the study of the trade-off between the length of PCP sand their query complexity, establishing the following main results(which refer to proofs of satisfiability of circuits of size n): 1 We present PCPs of length exp(\~{O}(log log n)2)•n that can be verified by making o(log logn) Boolean queries.For every ε&gt;0, we present PCPs of length exp(logε n)• n that can be verified by making a constant number of Boolean queries. In both cases, false assertions are rejected withconstant probability (which may be set to be arbitrarily close to 1). The multiplicative overhead on the length of the proof, introduced by transforming a proof into a probabilistically checkable one, is just quasi-polylogarithmic in the first case (ofquery complexity o(log logn)), and 2(log n)ε, for any ε&gt;0, in the second case (of constant query complexity). In contrast, previous results required at least 2 √logn overhead in the length, even to get query complexity 2 √log n. Our techniques include the introduction of a new variant of PCPs that we call "Robust PCPs". These new PCPs facilitate proof composition, which is a central ingredient in construction of PCP systems. (A related notion and its composition properties were discovered independently by Dinur and Reingold. ) Our main technical contribution is a construction of a "length-efficient" Robust PCP. While the new construction uses many of the standard techniques in PCPs, it does differ from previous constructions in fundamental ways, and in particular does not use the "parallelization" step of Arora et al. . The alternative approach may be of independent interest. We also obtain analogous quantitative results for locally testable codes. In addition, we introduce a relaxed notion of locally decodable codes,and present such codes mapping k information bits to code words of length κ1+ε, for any ε&gt;0.},

This approach naturally yields protocols secure for mixed (active and passive) corruption and general (as opposed to threshold) adversary structures, confirming the previously proved tight bounds in a simpler framework. Due to their simplicity, the described protocols are well-suited for didactic purposes, which is a main goal of this paper.}

isbn = {9781109444506},
publisher = {Stanford University},
address = {Stanford, CA, USA},
abstract = {We propose the first fully homomorphic encryption scheme, solving an old open problem. Such a scheme allows one to compute arbitrary functions over encrypted data without the decryption key—i.e., given encryptions  E (  m  1), ...,  E (  m t ) of  m  1, ...,  m  t,  one can efficiently compute a compact ciphertext that encrypts  f (  m  1, ...,  m  t ) for any efficiently computable function  f . Fully homomorphic encryption has numerous applications. For example, it enables encrypted search engine queries—i.e., a search engine can give you a succinct encrypted answer to your (boolean) query without even knowing what your query was. It also enables searching on encrypted data; you can store your encrypted data on a remote server, and later have the server retrieve only files that (when decrypted) satisfy some boolean constraint, even though the server cannot decrypt the files on its own. More broadly, it improves the efficiency of secure multiparty computation. In our solution, we begin by designing a somewhat homomorphic "boostrappable" encryption scheme that works when the function  f  is  the scheme's own decryption function.  We then show how, through recursive self-embedding, bootstrappable encryption gives fully homomorphic encryption.},

abstract = {Any proof of P ≠ NP will have to overcome two barriers: relativization and natural proofs. Yet over the last decade, we have seen circuit lower bounds (e.g., that PP does not have linear-size circuits) that overcome both barriers simultaneously. So the question arises of whether there is a third barrier to progress on the central questions in complexity theory.In this article, we present such a barrier, which we call algebraic relativization or algebrization. The idea is that, when we relativize some complexity class inclusion, we should give the simulating machine access not only to an oracle A, but also to a low-degree extension of A over a finite field or ring.We systematically go through basic results and open problems in complexity theory to delineate the power of the new algebrization barrier. First, we show that all known nonrelativizing results based on arithmetization---both inclusions such as IP = PSPACE and MIP = NEXP, and separations such as MAEXP ⊄ P/poly---do indeed algebrize. Second, we show that almost all of the major open problems---including P versus NP, P versus RP, and NEXP versus P/poly---will require non-algebrizing techniques. In some cases, algebrization seems to explain exactly why progress stopped where it did: for example, why we have superlinear circuit lower bounds for PromiseMA but not for NP.Our second set of results follows from lower bounds in a new model of algebraic query complexity, which we introduce in this article and which is interesting in its own right. Some of our lower bounds use direct combinatorial and algebraic arguments, while others stem from a surprising connection between our model and communication complexity. Using this connection, we are also able to give an MA-protocol for the Inner Product function with O (√nlogn) communication (essentially matching a lower bound of Klauck), as well as a communication complexity conjecture whose truth would imply NL ≠ NP.},
