Previous cryptosystems, based on the discrete logarithm, have been proposed by El Gamal (1985), Chaum, Evertse, van de Graaf (1988), Beth (1988) and G{\"u}nther (1989). The new scheme comprises the following novel features.",

abstract="We consider complexity of perfect zero-knowledge arguments [4]. Let T denote the time needed to (deterministically) check a proof and let L denote an appropriate security parameter. We introduce new techniques for implementing very efficient zero-knowledge arguments. The resulting argument has the following features:The arguer can, if provided with the proof that can be deterministically checked in O(T) time, run in time O(TLO(1)). The best previous bound was O(T1+$\epsilon$LO(1)).The protocol can be simulated in time O(LO(1)). The best previous bound was O(T1+$\epsilon$LO(1)).A communication complexity of O(L lg L), where L is the security parameter against the prover. The best previous known bound was O(L lg T).",

abstract="For many proofs of knowledge it is important that only the verifier designated by the confirmer can obtain any conviction of the cor- rectness of the proof. A good example of such a situation is for undeniable signatures, where the confirmer of a signature wants to make sure that only the intended verifier(s) in fact can be convinced about the validity or invalidity of the signature.",

abstract="We present a general method for constructing commitment schemes based on existence of q-one way group homomorphisms, in which elements in a finite prime field GF(q) can be committed to. A receiver of commitments can non-interactively check whether committed values satisfy linear equations. Multiplicative relations can be verified interactively with exponentially small error, while communicating only a constant number of commitments. Particular assumptions sufficient for our commitment schemes include: the RSA assumption, hardness of discrete log in a prime order group, and polynomial security of Diffie-Hellman encryption.",
