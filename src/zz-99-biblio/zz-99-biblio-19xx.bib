The schemes are provably secure against any known or chosen message attack if factoring is difficult, and typical implementations require only 1{\%} to 4{\%} of the number of modular multiplications required by the RSA scheme. Due to their simplicity, security and speed, these schemes are ideally suited for microprocessor-based devices such as smart cards, personal computers, and remote control systems.},

To show that x ε L, with an error probability of at most 2-k, our zero-knowledge proof system requires O(|x|c1)+O(lgc2|x|)k ideal bit commitments, where c1 and c2 depend only on L. This construction is the first in the ideal bit commitment model that achieves large values of k more efficiently than by running  k independent iterations of the base interactive proof system. Under suitable complexity assumptions, we exhibit  zero knowledge arguments that require O(lgc|x|kl bits of communication, where c depends only on L, and l is the security parameter for the prover. This is the first construction in which the total amount of communication can be less than that needed to transmit the NP witness. Our protocols are based on efficiently checkable proofs for NP[4].},
