\newIssue{issue:intellectual-property}{Set expectations on intellectual property disclosure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\incItem[it:intellectual-property]
Preamble
\newcol \ccontext\ Proposed in \itemXofNISTcomments{C22}.
				\propContrib\ Present (in one or two paragraphs), in a non-legalese way, several remarks about intellectual property (IP). A main goal is to raise awareness about the role that IP may take or might not take in the adoption of recommendations and requirements in the community reference document. We are aware this is a delicate topic, so a goal of the contribution is to also motivate future constructive discussion/consideration by the ZKProof community, e.g., about open-source, IP rights, reasonable and non-discriminatory IP terms, etc.

\newIssue{issue:clarify-C-in-CRS}{Clarify the public vs. non-public aspect of ``common'' in CRS enhancement}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\incItem[it:clarify-C-in-CRS]\label{it:syntax-setup}
Mostly in Chapter 1, starting in section 1.2; will also check for other applicable cases across the document.
\newcol \ccontext\ proposed in the "NIST comments on the initial ZKProof documentation" (April 06, 2019) --- item C11.
				\propContrib\ Clarify the distinction between common (as in shared between prover and verifier) and public knowledge (as in known externally). The lack of distinction was noticed in several parts of the document, when thinking of a comparison between transferable vs. non-transferable ZK proofs. CRS is sometimes being defined as public, although in practice it could be obtained as common to the intervening parties, yet private to a particular interaction. For example, line 177 says ``common public input'' when first talking of a "common reference string", but the ``public'' aspect is arguable – being public vs. common-but-not-public may make the difference between transferability vs. non-transferability.

For example, in an interactive protocol over the Internet, how do regular authenticated channels vs. ``ideally'' authenticated channels affect transferability? Would a non-transferable protocol become transferable when the prover signs all sent messages and the verifier uses the output of a cryptographic hash function to select random challenges?

For example, if transferability is a design goal then there are settings where it is possible to design interactive protocols for which the view (transcript) of the original verifier (interacting with the original prover) can later serve as a transferable proof for other verifiers.

\refsec{apps:scope-use-cases}

				\propContrib\ The last paragraph in Section 3.2 [old section number in version 0.1] says ``digital money based applications belong to the first model'' [public verifiable as a requirement]. This assertion appears implicitly scoped in a too narrow subset of conceivable applications about digital money. Conversely, one could consider a scenario where Alice wants to convince Bob, in a non-transferable way, that Alice bought something from Charlie.
