\label{sec:prelim:abstract}

Zero-knowledge proofs enable proving mathematical statements while maintaining the confidentiality of supporting data.
This can serve as a privacy-enhancing cryptographic tool in a wide range of applications, but its usability is dependent on secure, practical and interoperable deployments.
This ZKProof Community Reference --- an output of the ZKProof standardization effort --- intends to serve as a reference for the development of zero-knowledge-proof technology.
The document arises from contributions by the community and for the community.
It covers theoretical aspects of definition and theory, as well as practical aspects of implementation and applications.
