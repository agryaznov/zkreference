# zkreference
This is the official repository of the ZKProof Community Reference (ZkpComRef) and of the Community Proposals submitted to ZKProof. The ZkpComRef is a live document that is developed and written in a collaborative manner within the ZKProof Standardization effort. Its purpose is to provide a reference for the development of zero-knowledge-proof technology that is secure, practical and interoperable. The document intends to be accessible to a large audience, including the general public, the media, the industry, developers and cryptographers.

## Latest Version
The [version 0.2 of the ZkpComRef](https://docs.zkproof.org/reference.pdf) is dated December 31, 2019. We thank all the received contributions. You can see the specific changes in the "[diff](https://github.com/zkpstandard/zkreference/raw/master/diff-v0.2-from-v0.1.pdf)" file in this repo. Highlights:
- A consolidated preamble: new abstract, new context “About this community reference”, new IP expectations; more detailed “Table of contents”; new “Executive summary”.
- A “Version history” section and an “Acknowledgments” section after the main chapters.
- A new chapter on “Construction paradigms”, encompassing the previous section on “Taxonomy” of constructions, and including a new section on “Interactivity”.
- Several portions of revised text and content, for example on proofs of knowledge vs. membership, benchmark parameters, gadgets, and applications.

## Editorial Process
The initial ZkpComRef version was based on the [proceedings](https://docs.zkproof.org/reference#version-history) of the 1st ZKProof workshop. Subsequent contributions were based on [feedback](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/pec/documents/20190406-nist-pec-comments-on-zkproof-docs.pdf) and [discussions](https://community.zkproof.org/t/breakout-session-zkproof-proceedings-and-community-reference/152) held at the [2nd ZKProof Workshop](https://community.zkproof.org/t/2nd-zkproof-standards-workshop-in-berkeley-april-10-12/60/2). Thereafter, the ZkpComRef has evolved with a flexible editorial  process, focused on contributions from the community and moderated by a [team of editors](https://docs.zkproof.org/reference/process). The incremental improvement is organized in [yearly cycles](https://docs.zkproof.org/reference/process), including calls for feedback and contributions. See further details in the [ZKProof website](https://docs.zkproof.org/reference/process).

**Feedback.** Here is a list of examples of feedback we are looking for
- What portions of technical text can benefit from further clarification?
- What basic concepts to further clarify, such as membership vs. knowledge, etc?
- Each item in section 2.3 should be expanded into a new section — what to include?
- What new pictorial examples (diagrams, etc.) to add?
- What bibliographic references to add, to better support the claims and concepts?

Please send your feedback by email to editors@zkproof.org. When commenting on specific portions of text, please refer to the line numbers in the ["annotated changes" version](https://github.com/zkpstandard/zkreference/raw/master/changes-v0.2-from-v0.1.pdf) in this repo. (The [ZKProof community forum](https://community.zkproof.org) also remains as a resource for community discussion.)

**Contributions.** 
The latest call for contributions is dated [2020-Aug-14](https://github.com/zkpstandard/zkreference/raw/master/Call-2020-for-contribs-to-ZCRef.pdf).
Here are notes/resources about potential contributions:

- GitHub issues: Various topics of needed contributions are identified as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/zkpstandard/zkreference/issues).
